                    <h2>CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h2>
                    <h4>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</h4>
                    <p class="p1">It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in
                        Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute

                    <p>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
                        However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness
                        should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. <br> <br>
                        Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the
                        symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other
                        people, until you have recovered.</p>

                                    as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for
                                    disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or

                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals
                                    and then spread to people. More information about the <span>source and spread of

                                <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first

                                    person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on
                                    a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses

                                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the

                                    Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area,

                                    Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                                    why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                                    (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of

                                <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone

                                    infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves
                                    considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs
                                    and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
                                <p>Current <span>CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</span>

                                <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
                                <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>

                                    collected at least 24 hours apart.</p>
                                <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of

                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there

                                    around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks.

                                    as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by
                                    frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on
                                    your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth,
                                    and nose.</p>

                                    coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory
                                    virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person
                                    coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To
                                    protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
                                    them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and
                                    sneezing.</p>

                                    cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.
